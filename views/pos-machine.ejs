                <h2>How good is Bhojan Mitra?</h2>
                <p>We’re engineering Bhojan Mitra for fast-paced kitchens that can’t afford downtime. The pilot focuses on reliability, practical accuracy, and predictable operations so your staff can trust every spoken ticket.</p>
                <ul class="quality-list">
                    <li><strong>Practical accuracy:</strong> NLU tuned to restaurant talk — menu items, modifiers, timings and contextual clarifications reduce mis-heard orders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operational uptime:</strong> Designed for 24/7 service with offline fallbacks and local buffering so orders keep flowing even during short network interruptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faster order handling:</strong> Voice routes orders directly to the right kitchen station, reducing handoffs and wait times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pilot-ready validation:</strong> Working with early partners to iterate on real conversational data and accent samples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security & compliance:</strong> Enterprise-grade cloud sync with configurable local data options and secure transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> Easy review and correction workflows — voice suggestions can be confirmed by staff before routing, minimizing errors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proof points (what operators see)</h3>
                <p>Industry pilots show voice-assisted ordering can smooth kitchen traffic, reduce mistakes, and improve peak throughput. Bhojan Mitra focuses on practical KPIs operators care about: order accuracy, ticket-to-kitchen latency, and faster table/service turnaround.</p>
